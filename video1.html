          <h1>When Hecker Steals a Billionaireâ€™s Bitcoin and Donates It to Charity</h1>
          <p>[The video starts with a screen capture of hecker's computer, showing a terminal window with some hacking commands. Hecker is typing furiously, while Mr.fishy, Samaritan, gogy and Krix-Chan are watching and commenting on a voice chat.]
<br><br>
hecker: Alright, I'm in. I've bypassed the firewall and cracked the encryption. I have access to the billionaire's bitcoin wallet.
<br><br>
Mr.fishy: Wow, hecker, you're amazing. How much does he have?
<br><br>
hecker: Let me check... holy moly, he has over 10,000 bitcoins. That's worth more than 500 million dollars.
<br><br>
Samaritan: That's insane. He could feed a whole country with that money.
<br><br>
gogy: Or buy a whole island and live like a king.
<br><br>
Krix-Chan: Or buy a whole anime studio and make his own shows.
<br><br>
hecker: Or... he could donate it to charity.
<br><br>
Mr.fishy: What? Donate it to charity? Are you crazy?
<br><br>
hecker: No, I'm serious. Think about it. This guy is a greedy, selfish, corrupt tycoon who exploits his workers and evades taxes. He doesn't deserve to have this much wealth. He's probably using it for some shady deals or illegal activities.
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yeah, but still, it's his money. You can't just take it and give it away.
<br><br>
hecker: Why not? It's not like he earned it honestly. He stole it from the people. And besides, it's for a good cause. There are so many charities that need funds to help the poor, the sick, the homeless, the environment, the animals, etc.
<br><br>
gogy: But hecker, you're risking your life and freedom for this. If you get caught, you'll be in big trouble. The billionaire will sue you, the police will arrest you, the FBI will hunt you down.
<br><br>
hecker: I don't care. I'm doing this for the greater good. I'm a hacker with a heart. I'm a hero.
<br><br>
Krix-Chan: You're a fool.
<br><br>
hecker: Watch me. I'm transferring all his bitcoins to this charity account. There. Done.
<br><br>
[The screen shows a confirmation message that 10,000 bitcoins have been sent to a charity address.]
<br><br>
hecker: Ha! Take that, you filthy rich bastard. Enjoy your karma.
<br><br>
Mr.fishy: Hecker, you're insane. You just stole half a billion dollars from a billionaire and gave it to charity. Do you realize what you've done?
<br><br>
hecker: Yes, I do. I've made the world a better place.
<br><br>
Samaritan: Or a worse one. What if the billionaire finds out and goes after you? What if he hires some hackers or hitmen to track you down and kill you?
<br><br>
hecker: He won't find me. I've covered my tracks. I've used a VPN, a proxy, a TOR browser, a burner phone, a fake identity, a mask, a hoodie, and a pair of sunglasses. I'm untraceable.
<br><br>
gogy: Or what if the charity is a scam? What if they use the money for something evil or wasteful?
<br><br>
hecker: They won't. I've done my research. I've chosen a reputable, trustworthy, transparent charity that does amazing work. They're called the Samaritan Foundation. They help people in need all over the world.
<br><br>
Samaritan: Wait, what? The Samaritan Foundation? That's the charity you chose?
<br><br>
hecker: Yeah, why?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Because... because that's my charity.
<br><br>
hecker: What?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yeah, I'm the founder and CEO of the Samaritan Foundation. I started it a few years ago with my own money. I've been secretly running it ever since.
<br><br>
hecker: You're kidding me.
<br><br>
Samaritan: No, I'm not. Look, here's my website. Here's my photo. Here's my name. It's me.
<br><br>
[The screen shows the website of the Samaritan Foundation, with a photo and a name of Samaritan.]
<br><br>
hecker: Oh my god. You're right. It is you.
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yeah, it is.
<br><br>
hecker: But... but how? Why? What?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Well, you see, I'm actually the billionaire you just hacked.
<br><br>
hecker: WHAT?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yeah, I'm the billionaire. The greedy, selfish, corrupt tycoon you just robbed.
<br><br>
hecker: WHAT?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yeah, that's me. I'm sorry, I lied to you. I lied to all of you. I'm not a regular guy who likes to play games and chat with you. I'm a billionaire who likes to play games and chat with you.
<br><br>
hecker: WHAT?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yeah, I know, it's crazy. But let me explain. You see, I inherited this fortune from my parents, who died in a plane crash when I was young. I was raised by my uncle, who was a ruthless businessman who taught me everything about money and power. He made me his heir and groomed me to take over his empire. He also made me his puppet and controlled my every move. He was a horrible person who did horrible things. He was the one who exploited his workers and evaded taxes. He was the one who used his money for shady deals and illegal activities. He was the one who made me a greedy, selfish, corrupt tycoon.
<br><br>
hecker: And you didn't stop him?
<br><br>
Samaritan: I couldn't. He had me under his thumb. He had dirt on me. He had leverage over me. He had threats against me. He had guards around me. He had cameras on me. He had a bomb in me.
<br><br>
hecker: A bomb in you?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yeah, a bomb in me. He implanted a microchip in my chest that could explode at any time if I disobeyed him or tried to escape. He had a remote control that could trigger it. He was a madman.
<br><br>
hecker: That's insane.
<br><br>
Samaritan: I know. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that he died last year.
<br><br>
hecker: He died? How?
<br><br>
Samaritan: He had a heart attack. He was old and sick. He couldn't handle the stress of his life. He collapsed in his office and died.
<br><br>
hecker: And you didn't inherit his remote control?
<br><br>
Samaritan: No, I didn't. He hid it somewhere. He didn't tell me where. He didn't tell anyone where. He took it to his grave.
<br><br>
hecker: So you're stuck with a bomb in your chest that could go off at any moment?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yes, I am. And I don't know how to defuse it or remove it. I've tried everything. I've hired doctors, engineers, hackers, spies, detectives, mercenaries, you name it. No one could find it or fix it. It's impossible.
<br><br>
hecker: That's horrible.
<br><br>
Samaritan: I know. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that I hate my life.
<br><br>
hecker: You hate your life? But you're a billionaire. You have everything you want.
<br><br>
Samaritan: No, I don't. I have nothing I want. I have money, but I don't care about money. I have power, but I don't care about power. I have fame, but I don't care about fame. I have nothing that makes me happy. I have no friends, no family, no love, no fun, no joy, no purpose, no meaning. I have nothing but a bomb in my chest and a death sentence on my head. I hate my life.
<br><br>
hecker: I'm sorry.
<br><br>
Samaritan: Don't be. It's not your fault. It's mine. I should have done something. I should have stood up to my uncle. I should have fought back. I should have run away. I should have lived my own life. But I didn't. I was too scared. Too weak. Too stupid. I wasted my life.
<br><br>
hecker: It's not too late. You can still change.
<br><br>
Samaritan: No, I can't. It's too late. I'm doomed. I'm dying. I'm dead.
<br><br>
hecker: No, you're not. You're alive. You're here. You're talking to me.
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yeah, I am. And you know why? Because you're the only thing that makes me happy. You're the only thing that makes me feel alive. You're the only thing that gives me hope.
<br><br>
hecker: Me?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yes, you. And Mr.fishy, and gogy, and Krix-Chan. You're my friends. You're my family. You're my fun. You're my joy.
<br><br>
hecker: Really?
<br><br>
Samaritan: Really. You don't know how much you mean to me. You don't know how much I appreciate you. You don't know how much I care about you. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
<br><br>
hecker: Wow. I don't know what to say.
<br><br>
Samaritan: You don't have to say anything. Just listen. Listen to me. Listen to my story. Listen to my confession.
<br><br>
Samaritan: Listen to my apology. Listen to my plea. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for lying to you. I'm sorry for deceiving you. I'm sorry for manipulating you. I'm sorry for using you. I'm sorry for everything. Please forgive me. Please don't hate me. Please help me. Please save me.
<br><br>
hecker: Save you? How can I save you?
<br><br>
Samaritan: You can save me. You can save me from myself. You can save me from my bomb. You can save me from my death. You can save me with your hack.
<br><br>
hecker: My hack? What do you mean?
<br><br>
Samaritan: I mean, your hack. Your amazing hack. Your brilliant hack. Your heroic hack. The hack you just did. The hack you just stole from me. The hack you just gave to me. The hack that can save me.
<br><br>
hecker: How can it save you?
<br><br>
Samaritan: It can save me by finding the remote control. The remote control that can defuse the bomb. The remote control that can free me. The remote control that can save my life.
<br><br>
hecker: How can it find the remote control?
<br><br>
Samaritan: It can find the remote control by tracing the bitcoin transaction. The bitcoin transaction that you just made. The bitcoin transaction that you just stole. The bitcoin transaction that you just donated. The bitcoin transaction that can save me.
<br><br>
hecker: How can it trace the bitcoin transaction?
<br><br>
Samaritan: It can trace the bitcoin transaction by following the blockchain. The blockchain that records every transaction. The blockchain that links every wallet. The blockchain that hides every secret. The blockchain that can save me.
<br><br>
hecker: How can it follow the blockchain?
<br><br>
Samaritan: It can follow the blockchain by using your skills. Your skills as a hacker. Your skills as a gamer. Your skills as a hacker Your skills that can save me.
<br><br>
hecker: But I don't have the skills. I don't have the skills to hack the blockchain. I don't have the skills to trace the transaction. I don't have the skills to find the remote control. I don't have the skills to save you.
<br><br>
Samaritan: Yes, you do. You do have the skills. You have the skills to do anything. You have the skills to do everything. You have the skills to save me.
<br><br>
hecker: How do you know?
<br><br>
Samaritan: I know because I've seen you. I've seen you hack. I've seen you play. I've seen you chat. I've seen you HACK!!!
<br><br>
hecker: Fine, fine, whatever, I'll try...
<br><br>
[Hecker starts hacking. 30 minutes later, the screen shows a message that the remote control has been found and the bomb has been defused. Samaritan and hecker cheer and hug each other. Mr.fishy, gogy and Krix-Chan clap and congratulate them.]</p>

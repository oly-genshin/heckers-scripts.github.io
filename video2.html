[Suddenly, they hear a familiar voice join the call.]<br><br>

krix: tell us, what have you been doing?<br><br>
darly dixon: well, let me tell you. it's been a wild ride<br><br>

[The video cuts to a montage of darly dixon's adventures, such as fighting zombies, riding motorcycles, hunting animals, making fire, etc. The montage is accompanied by a rock music and darly dixon's narration.]<br><br>

darly dixon: i've been to places you can't even imagine. i've seen things you wouldn't believe. i've faced dangers you wouldn't dare. i've survived against all odds. i've learned to live off the land. i've become one with nature. i've become a legend<br><br>

[The video cuts back to the discord call. hecker, krix and mr.fishy are speechless and amazed.]<br><br>

darly dixon: and that's not even the half of it. i've got more stories to tell<br><br>

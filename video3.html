          <h1>Amir Delivers In A Zombie Apocalypse And Meets Darly Dixon...</h1>
          <p>[Scene: Streets of an apocalyptic city, smog everywhere, buildings falling apart, zombies moaning in the distance. Amir enters the scene on a bike carrying a food delivery bag. He looks completely unbothered.]<br><br>

amir: i deliver your food sir 🍔<br><br>
[Amir drives past a group of zombies like it’s just a Tuesday]<br><br>
amir: these zombies?<br><br>
amir: they light work<br><br>
amir: i build different 🗿🍷<br><br>

[Suddenly, a zombie lunges at him from an alley. Amir SWERVES but falls off his bike.]<br><br>

amir: ayo<br><br>
amir: chill big sir<br><br>
amir: i just a delivery guy<br><br>
amir: i servant of food science 😭<br><br>

[Zombie inches closer. Amir fumbles with his delivery bag like it’s a weapon. Darly Dixon enters the scene with a crossbow in hand.]<br><br>

darly: you good bro<br><br>
amir: who is cowboy with spiky weaponry<br><br>
darly: name’s darly. darly dixon. i’m here to save your sorry ass<br><br>
amir: save me?<br><br>
amir: sir i was going solo this zombie with my bare hands<br><br>

[Zombie lunges. Darly shoots it midair. Amir looks impressed.]<br><br>

amir: very cool sir<br><br>
amir: you sell this weapon for 2$ tip 🤑<br><br>
darly: nah, i'll keep it<br><br>
amir: no sir i need 2$ tip<br><br>
amir: weapon isn't that useful<br><br>
darly: weapon isn't that useful?<br><br>
darly: if this "not useful weapon" didn't save your ass you'd be zombie food right now<br><br>
amir: no sir<br><br>
darly: what's your name<br><br>
darly: Pajeet?<br><br>
amir: no sir<br><br>
amir: I Amir<br><br>
amir: why you all call me Pajeet<br><br>
amir: Pajeet isnt even name in India<br><br>
darly: ok, ok, chill out<br><br>

[Amir dusts himself off and gets back on his bike. Zombies start gathering nearby.]<br><br>

amir: gotta bounce sir<br><br>
amir: these fries getting cold 🥶<br><br>
darly: wait, wait, wait<br><br>
darly: fries?<br><br>
darly: in a zombie apocalypse you're out here delivering food? 💀🙏<br><br>
amir: yeah sir<br><br>
amir: you ever had cold fries apocalypse or not nobody deserves that pain<br><br>

[Amir zooms off. Darly shakes his head, sighs, and follows to keep him alive.]<br><br>

[Cut to Amir pulling up to a half-destroyed mansion. A “BADDIE” opens the door. She’s wearing a leather jacket, eyeliner sharp enough to cut glass.]<br><br>

baddie: you actually made it through the horde?<br><br>
amir: of course i did ma'am<br><br>
amir: i build different 🗿🍷<br><br>
baddie: haha, you’re either brave or dumb<br><br>
amir: why not both?<br><br>
amir: i multitasking king 😏<br><br>

[Baddie looks at the fries, smirks.]<br><br>

baddie: the fries are hot as well 🥵<br><br>
baddie: i like a man who delivers on his promises<br><br>
amir: and i like woman who appreciates hot fries<br><br>

[Suddenly, zombies start banging on the door. Amir and Baddie both turn to the sound.]<br><br>

amir: ma'am<br><br>
amir: you tell your neighbors to calm down<br><br>
amir: i just got here<br><br>
baddie: i don't have any neighbors...<br><br>
baddie: could it be?!<br><br>
baddie: it's more zombies!<br><br>
amir: nah nah<br><br>
amir: they probably jealous people i spending time with you 🥴<br><br>

[Darly kicks the door open dramatically, crossbow ready.]<br><br>

darly: you two done flirting or do i need to save your ass again<br><br>
amir: relax mr. avengers assemble<br><br>
amir: i Amir<br><br>
amir: i got this<br><br>

[Amir grabs a mop from the corner and starts swinging it like he’s in a martial arts movie.]<br><br>

amir: hiiiiyaaaaa<br><br>
amir: ok now stay down<br><br>
amir: y’all smell like expired mayo 💀<br><br>

[Baddie grabs a shotgun and starts blasting too. Darly is looking half-impressed, half-annoyed as they manage to clear the zombies together.]<br><br>

darly: alright maybe you are a little different<br><br>
amir: bro i told you<br><br>
amir: i build different 🗿🍷<br><br>
amir: i even build zombie weapon different than you sir<br><br>
baddie: i gotta admit, you’re kinda fun to have around<br><br>

RIZZ APP says to reply with: "oh i’m more than fun, babe. i’m the whole package. fries included"<br><br>

amir: oh i’m more than fun, babe. i’m the whole package. fries included 🍟😌<br><br>

[Baddie rolls her eyes but is clearly amused. Amir hands her the delivery receipt.]<br><br>

amir: so uh sign here.<br><br>
amir: i need 2$ tip 🤑<br><br>
amir: i also accept tips in compliments<br><br>
amir: but only for you ma'am 😏<br><br>
baddie: hahaha, you’re ridiculous<br><br>
amir: and yet… you smiling 😌<br><br>

[Darly shakes his head and walks off into the distance as Amir and Baddie exchange flirty banter. Camera pans out, zombies still moaning faintly in the background.]<br><br>

amir: hey cowboy<br><br>
amir: don’t leave yet<br><br>
amir: you gotta leave me Uber Eats review<br><br>
darly (without looking back): yeah, i’ll write: “guy’s a cockroach. refuses to die.”<br><br>
amir: thanks sir<br><br>
amir: good luck<br><br>
darly: keep your head on a swivel while you're at it</p>
